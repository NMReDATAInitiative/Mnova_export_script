# Mnova_export_script
This script, based on existing Mnova script, was developped by Damien Jeannerat

Installation:
Download and unzip the repository

Make the .csh file executable. On unix system:
chmod +x ./mnova2NMReDATA.csh
Preparation: add one or more .mnova file in the current folder and type:
./mnova2NMReDATA.csh *mnova
This will create NMR records for all mnova files present in the folder when the Bruker files are fond where they were when the mnova file was created.
