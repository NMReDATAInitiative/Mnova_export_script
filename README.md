# Mnova_export_script
This script, based on existing Mnova script, was developped by Damien Jeannerat

Installation:
Download and unzip the repository.

Open a shell in the folder.

Make the .csh file executable.

chmod +x ./mnova2NMReDATA.csh

Preparation:

Add one or more .mnova file in the current folder and type:

./mnova2NMReDATA.csh *mnova

This will create NMR records for all mnova files present in the folder when the Bruker files are fond where they were when the mnova file was created.
